##Linked List
Copy List with Random Pointer
	-use hashtable and iterate

Reverse List in Group of K ***
	-recursive
	-find group last element(edge case!), recursive, reverse, connect all
	-make sure save tail before update tail !!!

Merge k Sorted Lists
	-PriorityQueue use
	-Watch out for empty list, need additional check

Reorder List
	-cut, reverse, merge
	-watch out for empty list in case of cut

Sort List ***
	-Merge sort
	-when len == 1 remember to set tail to null, this will impact the recursive call

Rotate List
	-See 'Rotate List'

Add Two Numbers
	-Very easy idea, do not complicate it, watch for requirements!

Remove Duplicates from Sorted List ii ***
	-Use prev and counter to filter duplicates

Insertion Sort List
	-Two pointer; src/dest not necessarily connected, could be two seperate list

##bit-manipulation:
    use 1<<shifts to achieve range limit or make mask, e.g. IntegerMax = 1<<32-1;
Repeated DNA Sequences:
	use integer encoding of different characters, bit operation will help

##Dynamic programming:
Buy/Sell Stock :
	-Use local/global relations
 	-Remember to leverage variable type default values from JAVA spec: boolean->false, numeric/char->0, reference->null
 	-Once you use two array optimization instead of full array, the inner/outer loop relationship CANNOT be easily switched

Distinct Subsequence
	- Use local/global optimal relations

Max sum subarray //skip
	- Use local/global optimal relations
	- Extention is max product subarray

Combinations
	- Use local/global optimal relations

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
	- Use local/global optimal relations
	- use hashtable to record last position for given character
	- However watch out for local optimal is not (i - table.get(charAt(i))), there might be duplicates in between

Parlindrome Paritioning i
    - find all Parlindromes first
    - initialize should be 'LEN+1' instead of LEN, will outOfBoundary
    - Use DFS/Recursive to find all
    - Forgot to use conn before recursion

Parlindrome Paritioning ii
    - find all Parlindromes first
    - Use local/global optimal relations
    - Made mistakes

Generate Parenthesis
	- how to recursion to smaller problem
	- similar as Unique Binary Search Trees I/II

Climbing Stairs/Decode ways/Fibnacci/:
	-split into initialization and recursive phase
	-initialization phase: set up initial value, however this initial value may not be the same as result of this edge ca   ase when n = 0
 	-sol[0] base cannot be computed in recursive loop (while/for)
 	-Once using constant space optimization, remember to reset the values !!
 	-Once use while for loop, remember to increment i !!!

Triangle:		//skip
    -Similar 1-dimension recursive relationship
    -however we can go from bottom up instead of top down to speed up and easy to code

Unique Paths(I,II)/Minimum Path Sum	//skip
 	-Two dimension extention of Fibnacci

Word Distance()
 	-Traditional bigger/smaller problem; Two dimension extention of Fibnacci
 	-Recursive relationship is a little bit difficult to figure out.

Scramble String
	-Comparing with Word Distance, two source relationship subproblem structure
	-Implementation very easily can cause bugs: break for different sublengths, look up, check the code...

Interleaving Sting
 	-Traditional bigger/smaller problem; Two dimension extention of Fibnacci
	-recursive relationship boundary, watch out for what values to use

Unique BSTs I/II 	//skip
	 -Traditional bigger/smaller problem;
	 -Still similar to two dimension extention of Fibnacci, but there are very large number of smaller problem can be reduced to

Word Break
    -use valid lengths from dictionary to parse string
	-use BFS or DFS(LTE unless use tuning)
	-Word BreakII returns all lists, using DFS is much easier to code
	-无节操剪枝

Largest Rectangular //skip optimal, but not TLE
	-recursive relationship
	-What is stored in meta data results

Regular Expression Matching ////skip optimal, but not TLE ***
    -simple recursive relationship
    -but tooooo many edge cases!!!
    -need to redo to catch all edge cases

Wild Card Matching //skip optimal, but not TLE ***
    -simple recursive relationship
	-无节操剪枝
    -need to check how to prune

Longest Valid Parentheses //skip optimal solution, still TLE
	-change its problem to be has valid parenthesis
 	-Traditional bigger/smaller problem; Two dimension extention of Fibnacci
	-Recursinve relathionship boundary
	-Optimal solution should be O(N)

##Tree:
Binary Search Tree In-order Traversal Iterator:
	-In order iterator: Use a stack O(h) space, O(1) time
	-Pre order: Use a stack o(h) space
	-Post order: use a stack o(h)  as well, just some cases to take care
	-Post order can also reverse pre-order results
	-Java Stack is a class, not interface
	-Level-by-level iterator: Use a queue,  O(N) space
	-Level-by-level iterator(bottom-up): use swap queues + Stack(or linkeList, more simpler)    //worth another try
	-Zig-Zag: Use swap queues and linkedlist, use a reverse label to addFirst/Last  //worth another try

Tree UpsideDown: // needs practice
	-Iterative solution is clean and good, but could be easier
	-Did not think of the recursive solution

Unique Binary Search Trees I/II
    -Use copy tree, convert to a recursive-able function

Validate Binary Search Tree/Sum Root to Leaf Numbers [metadata top down]
	-Pass metadata to children during recursion
	-Watch out for leaf nodes
Path Sum i/ii [need clarification on path!!]
	-Watch out! root to leaft paths only
	-If inner node paths are also valid, we need special care of null nodes (return a list of (empty list but null))

Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum [This needs special care!!!][metadata bottom up]***
	-when null case is simple, leaf case may need special care!!
	-when null return null, use null check to set default value

min/max Tree Depth [metadata bottom up]
	-use recursion
	-watch out for null/leaf nodes/non-leaf nodes
Balanced Trees [metadata bottom up]
	-use recursion, keep track of height from bottom up

#Back tracking
Sudoku Solver
	-Backtrack Recursion
	-Remember to reset original state!!!
Word Search
	-Backtracking(DFS), reset visited state
	-board problem, just one point (0,0) edge case!!!
	-watch out for x, y range!!!
Word Ladder ***
	-Naive backtracking(DFS) will cause TLE
	-USE BFS + additional data structure(Map of depth, paths) to store paths
	(only if current depth == parent.depth + 1 add to paths)
	(do not need to add to queue if there is already depth info, otherwise cause TLE)
	-Use DFS to recovery all paths from the stored info
	-Do not pre-build all combinations of connection:
	(W*W*Len V.S W*Len*26)
Word Break: see Word Break

Subsets
	-Normal recursion
	-Sort first!!! (this is missing firstly)

Subsets_ii

	-List Equals is deep equal

Permutations i/ii
	-Recursion, no need to sort. Similar as substes to remove dup
	-Use stream takes longer!!(Do not use new, use collector)

Permutaiton Sequence ***
	-convert i to i-1 makes calculation much easier
	-recursion base condition wrong!: should check list size instead of index
	-should return prefix + val
	-permuation computaiton is wrong, see code

Combinations
	-use global/local recursion
	-direct recursion is not too bad
	-for DP implementation, building table is a bit difficult

Combination Sum ***
	-use recursion
	-pass subarray [0,n-1] and append to subsolution to make sure '<'

Combination Sum ii ***
	-Similar to Combination Sum, except each element can be used at most 1
	-need to use set to remove duplicates
	-input cannot be distincted

N queens i/ii ***
	-normal recursion

Letter Combinations of a Phone Number(edge case)
	-watch out for null/"" and digitis 0/1, should skip instead of remove all

GreyCode:
	-Simple recursion
	-always () shift operation result before +/- other operand
	-reverse iterate: reverse then literate, or push into a stack

Restore IP Address:
    -use a list of split point
    -watch out for reset using list!!!(not add(index, val), should remove and add)
    -special requirements about 0

	- A[mid] >= A[start] (A[start] > A[end]) : start= mid +1;
