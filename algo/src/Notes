bit-manipulation:
    use 1<<shifts to achieve range limit or make mask, e.g. IntegerMax = 1<<32-1;


Dynamic programming:
#Buy/Sell Stock :
	-Use local/global relations
 	-Remember to leverage variable type default values from JAVA spec: boolean->false, numeric/char->0, reference->null
 	-Once you use two array optimization instead of full array, the inner/outer loop relationship CANNOT be easily switched

#Climbing Stairs/Decode ways/Fibnacci:
	-split into initialization and recursive phase
	-initialization phase: set up initial value, however this initial value may not be the same as result of this edge case when n = 0
 	-sol[0] base cannot be computed in recursive loop (while/for)
 	-Once using constant space optimization, remember to reset the values !!
 	-Once use while for loop, remember to increment i !!!

 #Unique Paths(I,II)//skip
 	-Two dimension extention of Fibnacci

 #Word Distance()
 	-Two dimension extention of Fibnacci
 	-Recursive relationship is a little bit difficult to figure out.
