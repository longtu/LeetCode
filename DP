1)Return all possible subsets of a collection of integer S, with each subset in increasing order
  a)[combination]Iterative : ans(k+1) = ans(k) +: ans(k).append(S[k+1])
    //power set problem: can use a bit vector represents which one is used
    //http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/power-set/
  b)What if there might be duplicates in the collection?
    consider the case of S[k] == S[k+1], there is only several subsets in ans(k) needs
    to be updated with S[k+1], the size of ans(k) will help determine what are the subsets
    if ans(k) is also ordered
  c) Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1 ... n.
    //Method1:Use the same way as b), but remember to remove the subsets with size > k
    //Method2:combine(n,k) recursion to combine(i-1,k-1) for i = k...n
  d)return all possible letter combinations that a phone number can represents
    eg. "23" ->["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]
    //same as c)
2)Permutation Sequence
    The set [1,2,3,…,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
    By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
    We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):
        "123"
        "132"
        "213"
        "231"
        "312"
        "321"
    Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
    Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
    //See answer a recursion with:  
    public String getPermutation(ArrayList<Integer> digits, int k)
3)Unique Permutation
    Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations. For example,
    [1,1,2] have the following unique permutations:
    [1,1,2], [1,2,1], and [2,1,1].
    //Solution: recusion, but stop before the first element same as the integer being inserted

4)Combination Sum problem
  a)Combinations sum without duplicates
    //(0-1knapsack): difficult to remove duplicates recursions
    //Recursion DFS easier to code, however it is less efficient
    // in order to remove duplicates, either put the results in the interface and reset flag
    // or use return value and use the index to check if the same value index is being used
    //Conclusion: in case of duplication may happen, DFS with Results in interface and flag is much easier to code with

  b)Combinations sum with duplicates():
    //Recursion

5)Kanpsack http://blog.csdn.net/hhygcy/article/details/3955683
    a)Change Making Problem
    b)SubsetSum(Unique Subset would be good)
    c)Set parition to minimize the difference

6)Spirial Matrix
    a)Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
    //very easy to break the boundary condition, should test carefully 
    //Boundary condition is: one column
    b)Given an integer n, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.
    //This is an easier recursion

7)Restore IP address from a String:
    //DFS analogous process
    //Boundary check: when should be 0 invalid? what is the range of IP Address?
  a)Suduku Solver
        DFS

8) Triangle Problem
    a)minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.
    //bottom-up, save space(save initialization), only one instance of n array needs to be used
    // if keep using top-down, right to left can also save space usage
    //so the direction of recursion: top-down/bottom-up or left-right, right-left can help simplify the solution 
    b)Pascal Triangle
    //top-down

9) Subsequence problems
    a)Distingct Subsequences
    //One Dimension DP, needs sum on previous result
    b)Interleaving String
    //Two dimension DP, only one step recursion, therefore can be optimized using one dimension
    c)Longest Parlindromic Substring
    //Similarly with b), Two dimension DP, one step recursion, can be optimized using one dimension
    e) Edit distance:
    //one step, two dimention DP. can be optimzed using O(N) space
    //similar with longest common subsequence

10) Two step recursion to smaller problem, constant space
    a) Decode digits into Alphabetic characters
    b) Fibnacci Number
    c) Ways to sum up to N points from win/tie/lose
    d) Stolen house problem
    //think more about the problem relatioship
    http://codercareer.blogspot.com/2013/02/no-44-maximal-stolen-values.html

11)Scramble String:
    //Three dimension recursion
    //boundary and relation constraint between three dimensions
    //error in boundary of recursion see ERROR in code

12)Regular expression matches:
    Wild card matching:regular expression matching
    //DP is a good way to solve, however TLE, only greedy passes
    //Inner and outter two while loop
    //Greedy impl is very hard

    Regular expression matching with . and * support
    //very careful implementation, two dimentional dp but only two steps look-back
    //therefore eligible for space optimization

13)Jump Game
    //boolean problem: for loop, update max(which is boundary of the loop)
    //min step problem: for loop, maintain a interval of current jump times, update the interval

14) Max rectangular:
    //two dimension DP or use a stack/List to maintain increasing hight of rectangulars

15) BackTracking:
    1)Generate Valid Parenthesis: keep consistant relationship See 1.8: Remaining Right>= Left
    2)DFS
    3)Permutation, Combination
    4)NQueens Problem
    See 19) problem b

16) Unique Paths
    a)Simple one step DP, can be optimized using O(n) space
    //very similar to 12), but a extention to 2D
    b)if the step to right has to be smaller than down, see Topic 1.8 (f
    c)If there is obstacle
    //consider both direction would be affected(max/first?)

17) Classic DPs:
    DP1:
        a)Matrix Multiply Chain:
        //M[i,j] = min(M[i,k]+ M[k,j]+pipkpj) n^2 space, n^3 time
        //no optimization can be done
        b)Longest Common Parlindrome SubString/SubSequence
        //M[i,j] where j = i+k, k from 1,2,3....increasing,similar with a)
    DP2:
        a) Longest Common SubSequence
        //M[i,j] = M[i-1,j-1] +1 if A[i] = A[j] or max(M[i,j-1], M[i-1,j])   
        //Use a seperate Matrix to use as path reference the process
        //only one step recursion, can be optimized with linear space 

        b) Edit Distance
        //Very very Similar to a)
        //Cost can be arbitratry, and change the DP function a little bit
        
        c) Longest increasing SubSequence
        //Method1:L(i) = { 1 + Max ( L(j) ) } where j < i and arr[j] < arr[i] 
        //and if there is no such j then L(i) = 1, result is return max(L(i)) where 0 < i < n
        //O(n^2)
        //Method2: sort nlogn, the goes back to a), n^2
        
        d)桥两边的城市分别是a(1)...a(n)和b(1)...b(n).这里的要求a(i)只可以和b(i)之间造桥,同时两座桥之间不能交叉.希望可以得到一个尽量多座桥的方案.
        //same as c)

        e)Box Stacking. You are given a set of n types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the i^th box has height h(i), width w(i) and depth d(i) (all real numbers). You want to create a stack of boxes which is as tall as possible, but you can only stack a box on top of another box if the dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower box are each strictly larger than those of the 2-D base of the higher box. Of course, you can rotate a box so that any side functions as its base. It is also allowable to use multiple instances of the same type of box.
        //因为箱子可以翻转的缘故.我们首先定义我们的箱子的长宽高分别是h,w,d.为了避免重复计算,我们约定w<=d.这样每个箱子可以改成3个箱子.这样我们就不用在考虑旋转的问题了.第一步,我们先把箱子按照w*d的值来排序.(为社么要排序读者可以自己想想).然后我们的模型就开始用H(j)来表示第j个箱子时这个箱子的高度.记得最长递增子序列的约束条件是Ai<Aj.这里的条件只是改成了对应的di<dj&&wi<wj.同时原来的+1也变成了+hi.
        //H(j) = max{H(i)} +hj  where i<j Wi>Wj and di>dj
        
    DP3:
       a) Longest Common SubString
        //M[i,j] = M[i-1,j-1] +1 if A[i] = A[j] or 0
        //Final Solution = max(M[i,j]), O(mn) both space and time
        //how to retrieve back?http://gongqi.iteye.com/blog/1517447
         
       b) Longest increasing subString
        // O(N) trick solution

18) a)Maximal Rectangular of two-dimensional Array
    structure is similar as Two dimension subarray, however max needs to be updated everytime
    O(N^2) space, O(N^3) time
    b)Two dimension Maximum subarray
        //for one-dimension, using O(N) scan

19) Palindrom cutting:
    a)MinimumCut:
    //Method1: firstly using O(N^2) building Palindrome[i,j] map
       O(N^3): minCut(i,j) = min(cut(i,k)+cut(k,j))+1 if Palindrom[i,j] == false
                    = 0     if Palindrom[i,j] == true
    //Method2: only cut for Palindrom[i,j] == ture
        firstly using O(N^2) building Palindrome[i,j] map
        Then use the relationship: O(N^2)
               minCut(i) = 0 if Palindrome(0,i) is true;
                         = min{minCut(j)}, + 1) if Palindrome(j+1,i) is true
               ans = minCut(LEN-1) 
    b)AllPossibleCuts:
     //Method1: backtracking/DFS solution, with Palindrome[i,j] Map
     //Method2: similar with Method1, but more recursive, adding results from smaller problem
        Res(i,j) = aggregate all K such that String(i,k)*Res(k,j) where Palindrome(i,k) is true
